# Web2Mail
This is an archive of Web2Mail that was available in the Windows Store from 2014 to 2021.
At the beginning of development, Windows was 8 and new XAML-based store applications were supposed to replace the traditional win32 applications.
With Windows 10, its hard to maintain local development environment that includes old Visual Studio and Windows SDK.
so I have decided to retire the application from the store and disclose the source code to somebody who has interested in the legacy windows store application.
Please see 'doc' folder to read some copy of the online manual.
